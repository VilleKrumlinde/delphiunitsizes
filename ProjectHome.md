This program shows the size of each unit that is included in a Delphi exe-file. It also shows an approximate size of each symbol (classes, methods, procedures etc) in a unit.

How to use: Set "Project Options  - Linking - Map File" to "Publics" or "Detailed". Then open the resulting map-file with this program.

You can also use it in Delphi tools menu with parameters: $PATH($EXENAME)$NAMEONLY($EXENAME).MAP or simply associate it with map-files in explorer.
